Basic course taken at [Fundação Bradesco](https://www.ev.org.br), which is a basic website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## In this course I learned in the respective modules:
• What's on a Web Page <br> <br>
• Module 1 – Configure the structure of your web application <br> <br>
• Module 2 – Add Basic HTML to your Web Application <br> <br>
• Module 3 – Apply styles to HTML with CSS <br> <br>
• Module 4 – Add interactivity with JavaScript

### The objective of the course and my opinion:
This course was the first in which I had contact with JavaScript, the aim was to create a page that had an interactive button that changed the theme of the site, from a light theme to a dark theme, which I really enjoyed, even with a simple project. I highly recommend it for beginners like me. Several other projects will come from this.
